Dataset :
There are eight tables in this dataset: customer, lineitem, nation, orders, part, partsupp, region, and supplier. The tables are connected by foreign keys: customers place orders (customer to orders), orders contain line items (orders to lineitem), line items reference parts and suppliers (lineitem to part and supplier), parts are supplied by suppliers (partsupp connects part and supplier), and both customers and suppliers are linked to nations and regions (nation to region).
This dashboard shows two samples of "executive Summary" which showcases a quick glance at key supply chain metrics, tracks sales by segments, highlights price/mix performance and change in revenue at YTD.
